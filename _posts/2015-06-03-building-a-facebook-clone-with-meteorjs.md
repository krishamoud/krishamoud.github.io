## Goals

We must first define the features that facebook has that we would like to recreate.  
* A user must be able to sign up and then be able to log in
* A user must have a profile page
* A user must be able to make a post (similar to a blog) and also be flexible enough to post to other peoples "walls"
* A user must be able to make friend requests
* A user must be able to view a "feed" of activity going on with his or her friends.


Things currently not included in this tutorial
* Picture uploader (probably soon to come)
* editing profile details (definitely soon to come)

## Before we begin

I am not a great designer and I don't pretend to be.  However, I have wanted to make this tutorial for a while so I went and found a great [Twitter Bootstrap 3 Facebook template](http://www.bootply.com/render/96266) that I used to create this.  You should download it before you go any further in this tutorial. This tutorial assumes you have meteor installed in your dev environment.

### Step 1: Structuring the application

In your terminal run `meteor create facebook` then remove the files `facebook.html`, `facebook.js`, and `facebook.css` then make sure you add twitter-bootstrap to your project by running `meteor add twbs:bootstrap` followed by creating a file structure like the one outlined below.


I use the same basic file structure for all of my meteor apps.

    client/
      css/
      js/
      lib/
      views/
      compatibility/ (optional)
    lib/
    public/
      img/
    private/
    server/
      api/ (optional)
      config/
      helpers/
      lib/
      models/
      publications/

Now to just get it out of the way now add [this](https://github.com/krishamoud/meteor-facebook/blob/master/client/css/facebook.css) css file to `client/css/` **This is the only place where I will mention css** 


Great!  Now that we got that out of the way we can get to the fun stuff.  

### Step 2: Account Creation and Login

Every website needs a way to register.  This used to be hard but meteor makes it easy.
I used the `accounts-password` package built by MDG to make the login.


In your terminal run `meteor add accounts-password` or go to `.meteor/packages` and add to the file `accounts-password`


Now we have all the methods necessary to build a register/login system.


In `client/views/` we need to make a `main.html` file and a `main.js`.
`main.html` should look like this

{% highlight html %}
<head>
    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Facebook Theme Demo</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1">
</head>
{% endhighlight %}

Nothing crazy.


Next we need to get a way to render templates based on route.  I used [iron-router](https://github.com/iron-meteor/iron-router) for this project although recently [flow-router](https://github.com/meteorhacks/flow-router) has gained some popularity.  


Add it the same way you did the `accounts-password` package.

`meteor add iron:router`

Now that we have that we are going to route `login` and `register` to the correct templates.

I put my router code in the `lib/` folder because iron-router allows for server side routing and if you run it in the `client/` folder then you lose the server side functionality.  So create a file `lib/router.js` then add the following code.

{% highlight javascript %}
Router.route('/register',{
    template:"register"
});

Router.route('/login',{
    template:"login"
})
{% endhighlight %}

Now we have to actually create these templates.

I am very partial to having one folder per template which (in my opinion) should have exactly two files in it.
* 1: the html file
* 2: the javascript file

First we build the registration page.
First create a folder `client/views/register`
Then create the files `client/views/register/register.html`, `client/views/register/register.js`


{% highlight html %}
<template name="register">
    <div class="container">
        <div id="signupbox" style="margin-top:50px" class="mainbox col-md-6 col-md-offset-3 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">

                    <div style="float:right; font-size: 85%; position: relative; top:-10px"><a id="signinlink" href="/login">Sign In</a></div>
                </div>
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <form id="signupform" class="form-horizontal" role="form">
                        <div id="signupalert" style="display:none" class="alert alert-danger">
                            <p>Error:</p>
                            <span></span>

                            <div class="col-md-9">
                                <input type="text" class="form-control" name="email" placeholder="Email Address">

                        <div class="form-group">

                            <div class="col-md-9">

                        <div class="form-group">

                            <div class="col-md-9">

This again is nothing crazy.

The javascript that correlates to this page.
{% highlight javascript %}
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// @Date: 
// @author: 
// @description: This is where the user will register for the site
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Template Event Map
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Template.register.events({
    'submit #signupform':function(e){
        e.preventDefault();
        var email = $("input[name='email']").val();
        var firstname = $("input[name='firstname']").val();
        var lastname = $("input[name='lastname']").val();
        var password = $("input[name='passwd']").val();
        var username = firstname + lastname;
        try {
            if(!email.length) throw new Meteor.Error("need email", "You must have an email");
            if(!firstname.length) throw new Meteor.Error("need name", "You must input your first name");
            if(!lastname.length) throw new Meteor.Error("need lastname", "You must input your last name");
            if(password.length < 6) throw new Meteor.Error("password length", "Your password must be at least 6 characters in length");
            Accounts.createUser({username: username, email: email, password: password,
                                    profile: {firstname: firstname, lastname: lastname}}, function(err, id){
                if(!err) {
                    Router.go("/")
                }
            });
        } catch (e) {
            console.log(e);
        }
    }
})
{% endhighlight %}
This isn't crazy either but essentially what is happening is the template `register` is listening for a submit event from the signup form.  

Inside the function we first get the users information (i.e. email, firstname, etc) then create a username that is just the first and last name put together (this is for demonstration purposes only).  

After that we go into a try/catch statement that does some basic validation.  A user must have an email, firstname, lastname, and their password must be greter than 6 characters long.  

After it passes all of these checks it calls a method from the `accounts` package called `createUser` which takes alll that info and creates a user out of it.  It will either return an error as the first argument or the newly created userId as the second argument.

If there are no errors then iron-router will route us to the `"/"` route which we have not yet defined.

This page is now done.
