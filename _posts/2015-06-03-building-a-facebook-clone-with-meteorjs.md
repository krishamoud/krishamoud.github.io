## Goals

We must first define the features that facebook has that we would like to recreate.  

* A user must be able to sign up and then be able to log in
* A user must be able to make a post (similar to a blog) and also be flexible enough to post to other peoples "walls"
* A user must be able to make friend requests
* A user must be able to view a "feed" of activity going on with his or her friends.

Things currently not included in this tutorial

* Picture uploader (probably soon to come)
* editing profile details (definitely soon to come)

## Before we begin

I am not a great designer and I don't pretend to be.  However, I have wanted to make this tutorial for a while so I went and found a great [Twitter Bootstrap 3 Facebook template](http://www.bootply.com/render/96266) that I used to create this.  You should download it and I will walk you through how I decided to set up the file structure.
